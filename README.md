## Contents

### 1. **Perceptron**
   - **Description**: The perceptron is one of the simplest types of artificial neural networks. This section introduces the basic concept and implementation of the perceptron, including its role in binary classification.
   - **Example Code**: Demonstrates how to create, train, and test a perceptron using Python.

### 2. **Training and Testing: Digit Recognition**
   - **Description**: Learn how to split datasets into training and testing sets and apply them to digit recognition tasks.
   - **Tools**: Utilizes popular libraries like `scikit-learn` or `TensorFlow` for real-world dataset handling (e.g., MNIST).
   - **Objective**: Achieve a basic understanding of model evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

### 3. **Linear Regression Classification**
   - **Description**: Covers the fundamentals of linear regression and its application to classification problems.
   - **Highlights**:
     - Fitting a line to data points.
     - Understanding decision boundaries.
   - **Implementation**: Includes examples to build a classifier using Python.

### 4. **Logistic Regression**
   - **Description**: Explores logistic regression as a classification algorithm, emphasizing its probabilistic interpretation.
   - **Features**:
     - Sigmoid function.
     - Binary and multiclass classification.
   - **Hands-on**: Provides a step-by-step guide to implement logistic regression from scratch.

### 5. **Weight Decay**
   - **Description**: Introduces regularization techniques, focusing on weight decay to prevent overfitting.
   - **Topics Covered**:
     - The concept of L2 regularization.
     - The effect of weight decay on model complexity.
   - **Example**: Code snippets illustrating weight decay in neural networks.

### 6. **Validation**
   - **Description**: Highlights the importance of validation in machine learning workflows.
   - **Techniques**:
     - Cross-validation.
     - Train-test split strategies.
   - **Objective**: Ensure robust model evaluation and prevent data leakage.
